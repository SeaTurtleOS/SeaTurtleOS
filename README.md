# SeaTurtleOS

My custom hobby OS! I'm using the [OS Dev wiki](https://www.osdev.org) tutorial to write this, but I'm soon going to branch off, and write the code myself. The bare bones have been basically purely copied from the site, but that's fine. The bootloader contents of most OS are very similar at the beginning. So is the kernel. As the code is developed, the similarities will vanish.
